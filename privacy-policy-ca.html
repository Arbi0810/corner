							<p>We and our service providers may deny a verified deletion request if we must maintain your Personal Information to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Complete the transaction or provide a good or service requested by you for which we collected the Personal Information, or otherwise perform a contract between us.</li>
								<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity.</li>
								<li>Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality of our systems.</li>
								<li>Exercise a legal right provided for by law, including exercising or ensuring free speech rights.</li>
								<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (California Penal Code sections 1546 to 1546.4).</li>
								<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest if:
									<ul>
										<li>the research adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws;</li>
										<li>deleting the Personal Information is likely to make the research impossible or seriously impair it; and</li>
										<li>you provided informed consent during the initial data collection.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Enable our internal use in a manner that you would reasonably expect based on your relationship with us.</li>
								<li>Comply with our legal obligations.</li>
								<li>Otherwise use your Personal Information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>See the &ldquo;Methods for Submitting CCPA Requests to Corner Bakery Cafe&rdquo; section below for information on how you can exercise your right to delete collected Personal Information.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong><em>The right to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information</em></strong></li>
							</ul>
							<p>You have the right to opt-out of the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of your Personal Information to other businesses or third parties. &nbsp;The CCPA defines &ldquo;sell,&rdquo; &ldquo;selling, &ldquo;sale&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to include selling, renting,
								releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Once we receive an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as commercially reasonable, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date we receive the request. We will also notify all third parties to whom we have sold the Personal Information
								within the ninety (90) days prior to receiving the request that you have exercised your opt-out right and instruct them not to resell the Personal Information.</p>
							<p>However, if we have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that the request is fraudulent, we will deny the request and provide you with an explanation of our rationale.</p>
							<p>You may elect to opt-in to the sale of Personal Information after opting-out. In the event that a transaction requires the sale of your Personal Information as a condition of completing the transaction, we will inform you of this and provide instructions
								on how you can opt-in.</p>
							<p>See the &ldquo;Do Not Sell My Personal Information&rdquo; section below for more on how to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong><em>The rights of California consumers who are less than 16 years of age</em></strong></li>
							</ul>
							<p>We do not intend to provide goods or services to, or collect information from, California consumers who are less than 16 years of age.&nbsp; We do not sell the personal information of consumers who we actually know are less than 16 years of age.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong><em>The right to be free from discrimination</em></strong></li>
							</ul>
							<p>You have the right to equal service, and we will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, under certain circumstances, we may offer you special discounts or other incentives for the right to continue to collect,
								use, or sell your Personal Information.&nbsp; In that event, we will notify you of the relevant program&rsquo;s material terms and obtain your voluntary opt-in consent to the program.</p>
