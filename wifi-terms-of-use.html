<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p>If a third party makes a claim against CBC, the Operator, its suppliers, and/or licensors (&ldquo;Indemnitees&rdquo;) arising out of your use of the Service or your breach of the WiFi Terms of Use, you shall: (a) pay all costs to defend each and all of the Indemnitees; (b) pay any damages assessed against each and all of the Indemnitees in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or any settlement that you agreed upon with such third party; and (c) hold harmless and indemnify each and all of the Indemnitees from all losses, damages (actual and consequential), litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature arising from such claims. If you fail to meet your obligations under this Section, each and all of the Indemnitees shall have full authority and control of the defense and/or settlement of any such claim at your expense. Each and all of the Indemnitees will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>You agree that the WiFi Terms of Use constitutes the entire agreement between you and Operator regarding its subject matter, and it supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Operator regarding its subject matter. The WiFi Terms of Use and the relationship between you and the Operator shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Unless expressly waived by the Operator, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Dallas County, Texas.</p>
<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the WiFi Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever barred.

<p>If any provision of the WiFi Terms of Use is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then such provision(s) will be ineffective to the extent of such determination, and such invalidation of such part or portion of the WiFi Terms of Use shall not invalidate the remaining portions of the WiFi Terms of Use and/or the spirit of the WiFi Terms of Use and the remainder of the WiFi Terms of Use will continue and shall remain in full force and legal effect. Any waiver or amendment of any provision of the WiFi Terms of Use will be effective only if in writing and signed by CBC.</p>
<p>Any failure by the Operator, CBC, or third-party provider of the Service to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of the WiFi Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
