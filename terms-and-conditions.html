<p>The following terms and conditions ("Terms") constitute a binding agreement between the user (&ldquo;User&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) and CBC Restaurant Corporation (d/b/a Corner Bakery Cafe) and govern your access to, and use of, all or part of any website or mobile application of CBC Restaurant Corporation or its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "CBC,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;), including cornerbakerycafe.com, cornerbakery.com,&nbsp;cornerbakerycafe.jobs, catering.cornerbakerycafe.com, and any other site, mobile application, or online service where these Terms are posted (collectively, the "Sites"). The Sites are made available to provide information about Corner Bakery Cafe&reg; locations in the United States, and to provide certain marketing and other programs and services offered by CBC ("Programs"). Information made available through the Sites may apply only to participating Corner Bakery Cafe&reg; locations. These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with CBC for products, services, or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the event there is any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any other terms of use that appear on the Sites, these Terms will govern. However, if you navigate away from the Sites to a third-party site, you may be subject to alternative terms and conditions of use, as may be specified on such site, which will govern your use of that site.</p>

						</section>
						
						<section>
							<h3 class="bookmark"><a class="bookmark-topic" name="modification">Modification</a></h3>
<p>CBC reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify our Sites or to change or modify these Terms at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the updated Terms to the Sites with a "Last Updated" effective date of the revision. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of the changes or modifications, and to the extent permitted by law, you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued access to, use of and/or participation in the Sites after these Terms have been changed or modified (see Last Updated date above) signifies your acceptance of any updated Terms. As a result, you should frequently review these Terms to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access to, use of, and/or participation in the Sites. If you do not agree to the changed or modified Terms, your sole recourse is to stop using and accessing the Sites.</p>

						<section>
							<h3 class="bookmark"><a class="bookmark-topic" name="privacy">Privacy</a></h3>

You agree to (a) create only one account; (b) provide accurate, truthful, current, and complete information when creating your account; (c) maintain and promptly update your account information; (d) maintain the security of your account by not sharing your password with others and restricting access to your account and your computer; (e) promptly notify CBC if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches relating to the Sites; and (f) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.</p>
<p>There are no fees charged by CBC to use the Sites, but there may be data usage or other like fees owed to your mobile carrier resulting from such use, for which you are responsible, and you are responsible for payment of any items purchased through the Sites.</p>

						<section>
							<h3 class="bookmark"><a class="bookmark-topic" name="accounts">Accounts & Communication</a></h3>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information (i.e., user ID, password and/or challenge questions). You are also responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account, irrespective of whether you personally engage in such activities. You agree to notify us immediately in the event of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your user account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password.</p>
<p>If a User signs up for a Catering Rewards account through the Sites, the User is, by default, opted in to receive communications from CBC for the purpose of advising you of changes or additions to the Sites, about any of CBC's products or services, or for such other purpose(s) as CBC deems appropriate.
